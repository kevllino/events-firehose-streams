# Handling event data with AWS Firehose 

![architecture](firehose-delivery-streams.png)

## Description
This prototype demonstrates how to handle event data generated by a server. 
Several event types are considered, i.e. with different schema (cars and users). 

## Implementation
We use a firehose_publisher to produce 2 different types of event data. 
Each event is pushed to its own firehose delivery stream that will end up in an s3 bucket. 

Firehose is an AWS Kinesis technology offering batching of many small events, compression, conversion to other formats 
and also enables the use of a lambda to do in-line processing of the data before sending it to its destination. 
The different event are stored along a prefix describing their nature and the default partition of Firehose, i.e. year/month/day/hour.

The infrastructure is created using Terraform.
